Data Types: 

Data types in swift do not have to be explicitly stated; swift will define the variable type for us based on the value that we assign to that variable. 

- Defining a variable: 
	to define a variable in the swift language we have to use the var keyword
	
	var <variableName> 
	var myVariable = 100

in the example above swift will assume myVariable to be of data type Int (since we assigned the value of 100 to myVariable). 

- Explicitly defining a varibale:

	var <variableName> : <varibaleType>
	var myVariable : Int = 100

- Common data types: 
	String 
	Int 
	Float
	Double 
	Bool
